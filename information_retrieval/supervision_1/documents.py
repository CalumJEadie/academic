States. He is the first African American to hold the office. Born in
Honolulu, Hawaii, Obama is a graduate of Columbia University and Harvard
Law School, where he was president of the Harvard Law Review. He was an
energetic community organizer in Chicago before earning his law degree. He
worked as a civil rights attorney in Chicago and taught constitutional law
at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. He served three
terms representing the 13th District in the Illinois Senate from 1997 to
2004, running unsuccessfully for the United States House of Representatives."""

DOCUMENT_2 = """Albert Einstein was a theoretical physicist born in Germany who developed
the general theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics
(alongside quantum mechanics). While best known for his massenergy
equivalence formula E = mc2, he received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics
"for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery
of the law of the photoelectric effect". The latter was pivotal in
establishing quantum theory. He was never at Harvard or Columbia. His great
intellectual achievements and originality have made the word "Einstein"
synonymous with genius."""

DOCUMENT_3 = """Niels Henrik David Bohr was a Danish physicist who made foundational
contributions to understanding atomic structure and quantum mechanics, for
which he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1922. He developed the Bohr
model of the atom with the atomic nucleus at the center and electrons in
orbit around it, which he compared to the planets orbiting the Sun. He
worked on the idea in quantum mechanics that electrons move from one energy
level to another in discrete steps, not continuously. Bohr mentored and
collaborated with many of the top physicists of the century at his
institute in Copenhagen. He was part of the British team of physicists
working on the Manhattan Project."""
