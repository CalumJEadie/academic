### Motivation behind this repository

I get a great amount out of taking ideas from the abstract and implementing them. This
repository is a mixture of explorations into concepts and algorithms, revision and some
parts from my work ( although I'm quite aware of the department's view on supervision
answers and coursework so have left out anything too substantial ).

The repo is very much a reference and learning tool for myself rather than being intended
to be used / read by others however would be very happy if it was useful to others as well.
